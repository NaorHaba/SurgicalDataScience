run configurations
	- Only kinematics (if not run by now)
	- Augmentations (Also change hands labels)
	- Linear extraction for kinematics
	- run original architecture for comparison
		- for all runs reduce searching space
		
prepare code for submission
	- handle # TODO, # FIXME, irrelevant notes
	- document
	- README
	- prepare model files for submission
