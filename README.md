# SurgicalDataScience
 
To run the offline feature extraction of the frames from all surgery videos, you need to run `feature_extraction.py`

To run the model on all the splits you need to run the `train_experiment.py` file (make sure test_split parameter is set to None for all splits).

You can change any of the parameters in the args object to control the architecture and training parameters.

Good Luck :)
